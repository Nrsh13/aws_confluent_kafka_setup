# Description

This project Deploys a Secure Confluent Kafka Cluster on N number of EC2s. NOTE: Code will work fine for 3 Nodes cluster. For Single node, there are TOPICs Replication releated chagnes which should be done.

## Pre-requisites

- Make sure you have the right ansible and python version - https://docs.confluent.io/ansible/current/ansible-requirements.html#general-requirements
- Have your AD/LDAP details ready -> We setup Windows 2019 Server and Created AD User.
- Build required number of EC2 instances following confluent_kafka_infra_setup/README.md
- Validate password less ssh to all EC2s from Ansible Controller host (where you will run the ansible-playbook from)
- Update the hostnames in generate_self_signed_cert.sh as it will generate the hosts self signed certs.
- Setup required details in scripts_and_others/secrets_role/secrets/defaults/secret.yml before running the setup-cp-ansible.sh script. This will include LDAP Details as well as MDS Token Key Pair + Hosts Self Signed Certificate -> These are generated by setup-cp-ansible.sh script. Will need to run the script twice. refer script execution section further.
- During setup-cp-ansible.sh, secrets_role/secrets/defaults/secret.yml will be copied to roles/secrets/defaults/secret.yml.
- Execute scripts_and_others/setup-cp-ansible.sh which clones and setup cp-ansible code.
```
cd confluent_kafka_setup_secure/
sh scripts_and_others/setup-cp-ansible.sh

- This will generate tokenKeypairDir and selfSignedCertificates folders. 
- Use details from these folders and update in scripts_and_others/secrets_role/secrets/defaults/secret.yml
- Rerun the script (will not generate the Keypair and certs again) to copy this new secret.yml to roles/secrets/defaults/secret.yml or do it manually.
```
- Read console output of above script execution (mainly the bottom ones).

- Encrypt both the secret.yml files if pushing to github.
```
[root@ansible ~/aws_confluent_kafka_setup/confluent_kafka_setup_secure]# ansible-vault encrypt roles/secrets/defaults/secret.yml
New Vault password:
Confirm New Vault password:
Encryption successful
```

## How to Run 

- Copy inventory/dummyhostsInventory.yml to inventory/hostsInventory.yml and update as per your details.Once ready Test connectivity using ping module.

```
[root@ansible ~]# ansible -i inventory/hostsInventory.yml -m ping all
ansi-lab01-01.nrsh13-hadoop.com | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/libexec/platform-python"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
ansi-lab01-02.nrsh13-hadoop.com | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/libexec/platform-python"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
ansi-lab01-03.nrsh13-hadoop.com | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/libexec/platform-python"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
```

- Run ansible playbook - Either Pass Vault password from command line using --ask-vault-password or define the vault creds file location in ansible.cfg
```
ansible-playbook all.yml --ask-vault-pass
or to run a specific component
ansible-playbook all.yml --tags kafka_brokers --ask-vault-pass
```


## Cleanup
```
ansible-playbook scripts_and_others/cleanup.yml
```


## Other Info
- The last part in all.yml will set up required permissions. Refer scripts_and_others/setup-initial-permissions.sh
    - To all your MDS Super User to see all details(like Connect Cluster, Ksql DB, Roles Management etc) in Control Center.
    - Read access to ALL on Schema Registry
    - Required Permissions to your Cert CN (kafka-lab01.nrsh13-hadoop.com) - as per user_need_access_to_mytopic variable in hostsInventory - so that it can producer/consume messages to/from mytopic Topic.
```
- name: Post setup Permissions
  hosts: set_permissions
  become: true
  tags: set_permissions
```
- It will take upto 20 mins in the setup.
